      <h1>About Ruth</h1>
      <p>I’m Ruth Goodness Onah, and this little corner of the internet is where I pour out my thoughts, faith, and a sprinkle of humour — because life with Jesus is deep and delightfully unpredictable.</p>
      <p>Here at RuthSpeaksTruth, I talk about real stuff — faith, growth, womanhood, family, and those “God, are You seeing this?” moments we all have. I write from the heart, laugh at myself often, and remind you that even in chaos, grace still works overtime.</p>
      <p>So grab a drink, get comfy, and let’s do life, love, and laughter together... one honest post at a time.</p>
      <blockquote>Welcome to the truth zone — my truth, your truth, and God’s truth all dancing together.</blockquote>
